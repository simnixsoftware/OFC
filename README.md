# OFC
Oscilloscope Frequency Calculator

Everyone who ever used an old model of oscilloscope wondered if there is a better way to calculate the frequency or period of various voltages, since first models only displayed a graphical representation, which tends to be inaccurate.

Although using some transformations and calculations based on an oscilloscope's output can lead to some precise results, they prove to be slow and tedious.

Overall, the graphical signal output displayed by an oscilloscope is just too hard to read and interpret, since the user is not provided with exact numbers or calculations.

Oscilloscope Frequency Calculator, also known as OFC, takes advantage of an oscilloscope's the number of divisions needed to complete a full cycle to help users compute the frequency and period of such devices.

The program can calculate frequency and period by using the time per division, which can last seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.

Furthermore, the frequency result can be calculated in Hz, KHz, and MHz size units.

Oscilloscope Frequency Calculator features a reset button, that clears all the current values from each input window.
